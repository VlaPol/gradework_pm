The main goal of the project is to use the knowledge and skills acquired in Java courses.
Main technologies: Java, SpringBoot, JDBC, Hibernate, Spring Security, AOP, Thymleaf, Lombok, HTML, Bootstrap, Postgres
and a little JS for beauty :).
Project topic: Web application for project management.
When starting work with this application, the user registers or authorizes. There are 3 roles in application:
ADMIN, USER and GUEST.
Upon registration, the user receives the GUEST role, which can only be changed by the ADMIN.
Work begins with a page that shows all the employees and the entire project, as well as a diagram for clarity
ideas about how many projects are in what state.
The ADMIN has the following functionality:
- a page where the administrator can activate the registered user.
- the ability to create, edit and delete employees and projects.
The USER only has rights to view existing projects, workers and the current status of projects.
At the end of the project, the user must exit the application (log out).
p.s. all important operations are logged.
